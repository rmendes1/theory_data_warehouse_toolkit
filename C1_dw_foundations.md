## 🧠 The Core Asset: Information

Information is the most valuable asset in an organization and is handled in two primary systems:

### 🔄 Operational Systems of Record

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 📥 Data Flow | Focused on data being put in |
| 🔁 Usage Pattern | Users interact with one record at a time |
| 🛠️ Purpose | Supports repetitive operational tasks |

### 📤 Data Warehouse (DW)

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 📤 Data Flow | Designed to get data out |
| 📊 Usage Pattern | Queries return sets of rows, not single records |
| ❓ Usage Style | Users constantly change the questions they ask |

## ⚖️ Key Difference

> There is a strong dichotomy between operational systems and data warehouses.
> 

🔍 DWs are built to support analysis and decision-making — fundamentally different from the task-oriented nature of operational systems.

🚫 However, many so-called DWs are just operational system replicas on separate hardware — a critical design flaw.

## 🎯 Goals of a Data Warehouse

### 💬 Common Business Pains

> These recurring business frustrations shape the essential requirements for a data warehouse:
> 

🗣️ Real-world quotes from business stakeholders:

- “We have mountains of data in this company, but we can’t access it.”
- “We need to slice and dice the data every which way.”
- “You’ve got to make it easy for business people to get at the data directly.”
- “Just show me what is important.”
- “It drives me crazy to have two people present the same business metrics at a meeting, but with different numbers.”
- “We want people to use information to support more fact-based decision making.”

### ✅ Translating Needs into DW Requirements

| 🎯 Goal | 📝 Description |
| --- | --- |
| 📂 Easy Accessibility | Information must be understandable, intuitive, and quickly retrievable.  ⏱️ Minimal wait time for query results.  🔎 Understandable = Legible & clear to business users. |
| 📏 Consistency | Must present information in a credible, high-quality, and condensed form.  🧼 Released only when fit for consumption. |
| 🔄 Adaptability | The DW should gracefully handle change.  🔒 Changes must not break existing data or systems. |
| 🛡️ Security | Acts as a protective bastion for the organization's information.  🚫 Controls access to sensitive or confidential data. |
| 🧠 Decision Support | The DW's core purpose is to enable better, fact-based decision-making.  ✅ Only one true output: business insight. |
| 👥 User Adoption | A DW is only successful if embraced by the business community.  📅 If it’s not used six months after rollout, the project has failed the adoption test. |

## 🧾 Comparing a DW Manager to an Editor-in-Chief

Being a Data Warehouse (DW) Manager is much like being the editor-in-chief of a magazine. Both roles center around delivering quality content to the right audience.

### 🧑‍💼 What a Magazine Editor Does

| Task | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 👥 Understand Readers | Identify your audience demographically |
| 📚 Tailor Content | Learn what your readers want from the magazine |
| 🌟 Focus on Value | Identify top readers—those who renew and engage |
| 📣 Grow Readership | Attract new readers and increase awareness |

### 📊 What a DW Manager Does

> A DW Manager is a publisher of the right data.
> 

| Responsibility | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 🧭 Be Business-Driven | Understand what data the business needs |
| 🧹 Ensure Quality | Gather data from many sources and clean it for consistency |
| 🏗️ Curate & Publish | Prepare and publish data so it’s ready for consumption |
| 🚀 Support, Not Showcase, Technology | Technology is just the delivery mechanism—never the main focus |

📌 Your role is not to highlight tech or tools, but to deliver meaningful, reliable, and actionable data—driven by business needs.

### 🎯 Why Use Dimensional Modeling?

| Requirement | Benefit |
| --- | --- |
| 👥 Business-Friendly | Models are understandable and intuitive for business users |
| ⚡ Fast Performance | Delivers superior query performance, especially for BI workloads |

🧩 Normalized (3NF) schemas are great for operational systems, but too complex for business users and too inefficient for analytical queries.

> ✅ Dimensional models contain the same information as normalized models—but optimized for readability, speed, and adaptability.

## 🌟 Star Schemas vs. 🧊 OLAP Cubes

| Feature | Star Schema | OLAP Cube |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 📚 Type | Relational (RDBMS) | Multidimensional (OLAP) |
| 🧠 Concept | Based on dimensions and facts | Also based on dimensions and facts |
| 💡 Logical Design | Same across both | Same core structure |
| 🧮 Physical Storage | Tables (RDBMS) | Specialized multidimensional formats |
| 🚀 Query Speed | Fast | Extremely fast |
| 🔧 Functionality | Standard SQL | Richer analytical capabilities |
| 🕒 Load Performance | Faster loads | Slower with large datasets |

<img src="C1_image1.png"/>

📝 Recommendation:

- Load atomic (detailed) data into a star schema first.
- Build optional OLAP cubes from the star schema for advanced analysis.

## ⚙️ OLAP Deployment Considerations

Although the capabilities of OLAP technology are continuously improving, we generally recommend that detailed, atomic information be loaded into a star schema; optional OLAP cubes are then populated from the star schema.

| # | Consideration |
| --- | --- |
| 1️⃣ | Star schemas in RDBMS are a solid foundation for OLAP cubes |
| 2️⃣ | OLAP cubes offer fast performance, though RDBMS performance is catching up thanks to in-memory and columnar DBs |
| 3️⃣ | OLAP tools vary more between vendors than relational databases, making BI migration harder |
| 4️⃣ | OLAP cubes typically offer more advanced security features |
| 5️⃣ | OLAP provides richer, more complex analytical functions than standard SQL |
| 6️⃣ | OLAP cubes handle slowly changing dimension (SCD) type 2 well, but reprocessing may be needed for other SCD types |
| 7️⃣ | Supports transaction and periodic snapshot fact tables well, but not accumulating snapshots |
| 8️⃣ | Natively supports complex, ragged hierarchies (e.g., org charts, BOMs) better than RDBMSs |
| 9️⃣ | Some OLAP tools lack dimension aliasing, requiring duplicate dimensions |

## 📊 Fact Tables: The Core of Measurements

A fact represents a measurable business event.

> 🧾 Imagine observing a sales counter and recording each transaction’s quantity and dollar amount — that’s a fact in action.
> 

**Each fact table row corresponds to a single event in the real world, such as a sale or an order — a cornerstone concept in dimensional modeling.**

### **🧮 Types of Facts**

| Type            | Description                                                                 | Example                | Additivity      |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| Additive        | Can be summed across all dimensions                                         | Sales Amount           | Fully additive  |
| Semi-additive   | Can be summed across some, but not all, dimensions (often not across time)  | Account Balance        | Semi-additive   |
| Non-additive    | Cannot be summed across any dimension                                       | Unit Price             | Non-additive    |

- **Additivity is crucial** because BI tools often aggregate large numbers of fact rows[5].
- **Textual facts** are rare and usually should be stored in dimension tables unless they are unique per event.

### **🧩 Fact Table Structure**

| Component         | Emoji | Description                                                                                   |
|-------------------|:-----:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Foreign Keys      | 🔑    | Link to dimension tables (e.g., Product_ID, Date_ID, Store_ID)                                 |
| Facts/Measures    | 📏    | Numeric business metrics (e.g., Sales_Amount, Quantity)                                       |
| Composite Key     | 🧷    | Uniquely identifies each row, often a combination of foreign keys                             |
| Audit Attributes  | 📝    | Metadata for data lineage and quality (e.g., created date, last modified by)                  |

**Example:**

| **Sale_ID** | **Date_ID** | **Product_ID** | **Store_ID** | **Sale_Amount** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 101 | 201 | 301 | 50.00 |
| 2 | 102 | 202 | 302 | 30.00 |

## **🔗 Referential Integrity**

- **Fact tables** reference dimension tables via foreign keys.
- **Referential integrity** ensures every foreign key in the fact table matches a primary key in a dimension table.
- Access to facts is always through joins to dimensions.

## **📏 Fact Table Grain**

- **Grain** defines the level of detail (e.g., one row per sales transaction).
- Each row should represent a single, atomic measurement event.

## **📦 Fact Table Types**

| Type                      | Emoji | Description                                                                                           | Example                        |
|---------------------------|:-----:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Transaction Fact Table    | 🧾    | Records individual events at the lowest possible granularity                                           | Sales transactions             |
| Periodic Snapshot Table   | 📅    | Captures measurements at regular intervals (e.g., daily, monthly)                                     | Daily inventory levels         |
| Accumulating Snapshot     | 📈    | Tracks progress of a process through multiple stages/milestones                                       | Order fulfillment process      |

## **🚫 What Not to Do**

- **Do not fill fact tables with zeros** to represent no activity-only record actual events. This keeps tables sparse and efficient.
- **Avoid storing redundant textual data** in fact tables. Use dimensions for descriptions unless the text is unique per event.

### 🧵 Example: Textual Fact (Rare Case)

Let's say we have a fact table called "Sales_Fact" with dimensions like "Product," "Customer," and "Time." One of the columns in the fact table could be a textual fact, such as "Sales_Description," which contains a textual description or note associated with each sale.

| Sales_ID | Product_ID | Customer_ID | Time_ID | Sales_Amount | Sales_Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 101 | 1001 | 20240501 | 50.00 | "Customer bought a shirt and jeans" |
| 2 | 102 | 1002 | 20240502 | 30.00 | "Customer purchased two books" |

- **Date_ID, Product_ID, Store_ID**: Foreign keys to dimension tables
- **Sale_Amount**: Additive fact
- **Sales_Description**: Rare textual fact (use sparingly)

### **📏 Fact Table Characteristics**

- **Deep, not wide:** Many rows, relatively few columns[2][3].
- **Consumes most storage:** Often 90%+ of dimensional model space.
- **Composite key:** Usually made up of foreign keys.
- **Many-to-many relationships:** Each fact links to multiple dimensions.


### **🛠️ Fact Table Design Best Practices**

- Store only true activity (no zero rows).
- Use numeric, additive facts whenever possible.
- Maintain referential integrity with dimension tables.
- Clearly define the grain before designing.
- Use composite keys for uniqueness.
- Only include textual facts when absolutely necessary.
