## Fundamental Concepts

> ‚ÄúSimplicity is the fundamental key that allows users to understand databases easily and software to navigate databases efficiently.‚Äù ‚Äî Kimball & Ross
> 

### ‚ú® Essential Techniques for Every Dimensional Design

These foundational techniques must be considered in every dimensional modeling effort. They are referenced throughout the book and underpin all advanced modeling strategies.

### üìù Gather Business Requirements & Data Realities

- **Purpose:**¬†Understand business needs and the realities of source data before modeling.
- **How:**
    - Conduct sessions with business representatives to clarify objectives, KPIs, and analytic needs.
    - Meet with source system experts and perform high-level data profiling to assess data feasibility.
- **Why:**¬†Aligns the data warehouse with real business goals and ensures the data required is available and usable.

> ‚ÄúRequirement gathering is vital to ensure department goals align with the overall project and to achieve stakeholder buy-in.‚Äù
> 

### ü§ù Collaborative Dimensional Modeling Workshops

- **Approach:**¬†Design models collaboratively with business subject matter experts and data governance representatives.
- **Process:**
    - The data modeler leads interactive workshops, not isolated design.
    - Workshops help clarify requirements and ensure the model fits business realities.
- **Outcome:**¬†Ensures the dimensional model reflects true business needs and secures business buy-in.

### üîÑ Four-Step Dimensional Design Process

| **Step** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| 1Ô∏è‚É£ Select the business process | Identify the operational activity to model (e.g., order taking, claims processing). |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£ Declare the grain | Define exactly what a single fact table row represents (the ‚Äúgrain‚Äù). |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£ Identify the dimensions | List the descriptive attributes (who, what, where, when, why, how). |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£ Identify the facts | Determine the numeric measurements (facts) to be stored. |
- **Note:**¬†These steps are iterative and require business and data input at every stage.

### üè¢ Business Processes

- **Definition:**¬†Operational activities that generate measurable events (e.g., sales, registrations).
- **Fact Table Focus:**¬†Each fact table typically models a single business process.
- **Significance:**¬†Selecting the right process sets the design target and guides grain, dimension, and fact choices.

### üß± Grain

- **Definition:**¬†The grain specifies what each row in the fact table represents (e.g., one transaction, one daily snapshot).
- **Importance:**¬†Declaring grain is a binding contract for the design‚Äîdimensions and facts must be consistent with it.
- **Best Practice:**¬†Start with atomic grain (lowest detail) for flexibility and robust querying; summary grains can be added later for performance.
- **Rule:**¬†Do not mix different grains in the same fact table.

### üßë‚Äçüíº Dimensions for Descriptive Context

- **Role:**¬†Provide the ‚Äúwho, what, where, when, why, and how‚Äù for each business event.
- **Use:**¬†BI tools use dimensions for filtering and grouping facts.
- **Design Tips:**
    - Dimensions should be single-valued per fact row when possible.
    - Heavy focus on data governance and development, as dimensions shape the user‚Äôs BI experience.
- **Nickname:**¬†Dimensions are the ‚Äúsoul‚Äù of the data warehouse.

### üìä Facts for Measurements

- **Definition:**¬†Numeric measurements resulting from business process events.
- **Rule:**¬†Each fact must align with the declared grain.
- **Example:**¬†In retail, ‚Äúquantity sold‚Äù and ‚Äúextended price‚Äù are facts; ‚Äústore manager‚Äôs salary‚Äù is not.

### ‚≠ê Star Schemas & OLAP Cubes

| **Structure** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Star Schema** | Fact tables linked to dimension tables via primary/foreign keys in a relational DBMS. |
| **OLAP Cube** | Multidimensional structure (often derived from star schemas) accessed via analytic languages (e.g., MDX). |
- **Purpose:**¬†Both structures support analytical queries; OLAP cubes often serve as aggregate or final deployment layers.

### üõ†Ô∏è Graceful Extensions to Dimensional Models

Dimensional models are designed for resilience and easy extension:

- **Add facts:**¬†New columns for facts consistent with the grain.
- **Add dimensions:**¬†New foreign key columns, if they don‚Äôt change the grain.
- **Add attributes:**¬†New columns in dimension tables.
- **Make grain more atomic:**¬†Add attributes to dimensions and restate the fact table at a lower grain, preserving column names.

> ‚ÄúThese changes can be implemented without altering existing BI queries or applications, and without changing query results.‚Äù
> 

### üö¶ Key points

- **Business-driven:**¬†Always start with business requirements and realities.
- **Collaborative:**¬†Involve business and technical experts throughout.
- **Structured:**¬†Follow the four-step design process.
- **Consistent:**¬†Declare and respect the grain.
- **Flexible:**¬†Design for easy extension and robust analysis.

## Basic Fact Table Techniques

### üèóÔ∏è Fact Table Structure

- **Definition:**
    - Stores numeric measures from real-world operational events.
    - Each row = one measurement event (at the declared grain).
- **Components:**
    - Numeric facts (measures)
    - Foreign keys to all associated dimensions
    - Optional: degenerate dimension keys, date/time stamps
- **Purpose:**
    - Central target for computations and aggregations in BI queries.
- **Design Principle:**
    - Based on real events, not on report layouts.

### ‚ûï Additive, Semi-Additive, Non-Additive Facts

| **Type** | **Description** | **Example** | **Summable Across...** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Additive** | Can be summed across all dimensions | Sales amount, Quantity | All dimensions |
| **Semi-Additive** | Can be summed across some, but not all, dimensions | Account balance | Some (e.g., not time) |
| **Non-Additive** | Cannot be summed across any dimension; often ratios or percentages | Profit margin, Rates | None |

> üí°¬†Tip: For non-additive facts, store additive components and calculate the final value in the BI layer or OLAP cube.
> 

### üö´ Nulls in Fact Tables

- **Facts:**
    - Nulls are handled gracefully by aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, etc.).
- **Foreign Keys:**
    - Nulls are¬†**not allowed**¬†(would break referential integrity).
    - Instead, use a default/‚Äúunknown‚Äù row in the dimension table with a surrogate key.

### üîó Conformed Facts

- **Definition:**
    - Same measurement appears in multiple fact tables.
- **Rule:**
    - If definitions are identical, use the same name.
    - If definitions differ, use different names to avoid confusion.
- **Goal:**
    - Ensure consistency and clarity for cross-table analysis.

### üßæ Transaction Fact Tables

- **Grain:**
    - One row per event at a point in space and time (atomic).
- **Characteristics:**
    - Most ‚Äúdimensional‚Äù (many dimensions possible)
    - Rows exist only for actual events (can be dense or sparse)
    - Always includes foreign keys for all dimensions, optional time stamps, degenerate keys
- **Use Case:**
    - Maximum flexibility for slicing/dicing transaction data.

### üìÖ Periodic Snapshot Fact Tables

- **Grain:**
    - One row per period (day, week, month, etc.), summarizing all events in that period.
- **Characteristics:**
    - Rows inserted for every period, even if no activity (zero/null facts)
    - Typically contains many facts
    - Foreign keys are uniformly dense
- **Use Case:**
    - Tracking balances, inventories, or other periodic summaries.

### üèÅ Accumulating Snapshot Fact Tables

- **Grain:**
    - One row per process instance, updated as the process moves through milestones.
- **Characteristics:**
    - Suitable for processes with defined start, steps, and end (e.g., order fulfillment)
    - Includes date foreign keys for each milestone
    - Rows are updated as process progresses (unlike other fact tables)
    - May include lag measurements, milestone counters
- **Use Case:**
    - Workflow/pipeline tracking (orders, claims, etc.)

### üóÇÔ∏è Factless Fact Tables

- **Definition:**
    - No numeric facts, just the intersection of dimension keys.
- **Use Cases:**
    - Recording events without measures (e.g., student attendance)
    - Analyzing ‚Äúwhat didn‚Äôt happen‚Äù by comparing possible vs. actual events
- **Structure Example:**
    
    
    | **Date Key** | **Student Key** | **Class Key** | **...** |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | 20240522 | 123 | 456 | ... |

### üìà Aggregate Fact Tables & OLAP Cubes

- **Aggregate Fact Tables:**
    - Rollups of atomic fact data for faster queries
    - Available alongside atomic tables for BI tools to choose the best level (aggregate navigation)
    - Contain foreign keys to shrunken (aggregated) dimensions
- **OLAP Cubes:**
    - Multidimensional aggregates, accessed directly by users
    - Built similarly to aggregate tables, but optimized for user interaction

> üèéÔ∏è¬†Aggregates = Indexes for your data warehouse: they boost performance but are not directly queried by users.
> 

### üß© Consolidated Fact Tables

- **Purpose:**
    - Combine facts from multiple processes at the same grain (e.g., sales actuals + forecasts).
- **Benefits:**
    - Simplifies cross-process analysis (e.g., actual vs. forecast)
    - Reduces complexity for BI tools
- **Trade-off:**
    - Increases ETL complexity, but eases analytic burden.

### üìù Summary Table

| **Fact Table Type** | **Grain** | **Update Pattern** | **Typical Use Case** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Transaction | Event | Insert only | Sales, Orders, Payments |
| Periodic Snapshot | Period (e.g., day) | Insert only | Inventory, Account Balances |
| Accumulating Snapshot | Process instance | Update as process | Order Fulfillment, Claims |
| Factless | Event (no measures) | Insert only | Attendance, Event Participation |
| Aggregate | Summarized | Insert/refresh | Performance Optimization |
| Consolidated | Multiple processes | Insert/update | Actuals vs. Forecasts |

## üö¶ Key Points

- Fact tables are the¬†**core**¬†of dimensional models, holding numeric facts and foreign keys.
- Choose the right fact table type for your business process and analytic needs.
- Design for performance (aggregates), flexibility (atomic grain), and clarity (conformed facts).
- Avoid nulls in foreign keys; use default dimension rows instead.
- Factless tables and consolidated tables are powerful tools for special analytic scenarios.
